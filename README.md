# care-access-and-HIV-prevalence
In California, >130,000 people have HIV, with about 4,500 new diagnoses each year. 
Underserved communities, especially in urban areas, are disproportionately affected by 
HIV due to a lack of access to testing, treatment, and prevention services.

The AIDSVu database provided HIV prevalence per 100,000 residents by zip codes (n= 508) in 5 California counties: 
San Francisco, Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego. The California Health Interview Survey determined 
population percent reporting delayed medical care. Zip Codes were classified as rural, suburban, and urban
RStudio produced correlation and linear regression analysis. 

We conclude that HIV prevalence and delayed care access has a weak but significant positive correlation in some CA 
counties. Delaying care can impact the number of individuals being diagnosed with HIV.

Focus on improving early detection through expanded: HIV testing programs, facilitating linkage to care, 
and providing comprehensive support services. Government grants can fund healthcare infrastructure development, 
HIV testing and treatment services, and community based education.
